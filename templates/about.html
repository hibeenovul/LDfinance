        <p>
            This project was started by I and my partner an the project was started because I had the interest in seeing
            how
            the financial world works. Building a website where financial transactions could be carried out means a lot
            and
            knowing more about this would give me the opportunity to know more about thhe finaincial world.

        <p>Take a look at our github profile to see or code.
